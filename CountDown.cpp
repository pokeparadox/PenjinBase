/**--------------------------------

How to implement:
- Create a static member function of a class with the following implementation
void CLASS::FUNCTIONNAME(void* object)
{
    CLASS* self = (CLASS*) object;
    // do stuff here use self-> to access class datamembers and functions
}

- This usually acts as a wrapper function, you can do stuff in there or make it private and
    redirect the function call to another (public) function

- initialize the countdown like this:
    ctr.init(2000,MILLI_SECONDS,(void*) this, &CLASS::FUNCTIONNAME); // 2000 milliseconds countdown

- The counter has to be updated in order for the callback to take place, so the update() function has
    to be called on a regular basis (in a state update function for example)
